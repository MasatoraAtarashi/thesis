The recent spread of IoT is backed by the improved performance and the increased functionality of low-power devices.
On the other hand, the growing variety of uses of low-power devices with diversified CPU architectures leads complexity of software dvelopment for these devices.

The aproaches to execute one shared program on multiple devices with different CPU architectures include the following;
running a program compiled for different CPU architectures with CPU emulation,
and interpreting IR (intermediate representation) on a virtual machine.
